# 关于本模组

## 项目背景

正如您所知， Ronivan 已不幸离世。他的模组极大地拓展了游戏基础进程，其内容规模堪比 DLC。这些作品不应因失去更新而损坏（更新导致兼容性问题终会发生）。为此，我启动了这个项目。

## 项目目标

本项目旨在整合 Ronivan 所有模组，形成一个可配置的"模组包"。玩家可自由禁用不想体验的模块，甚至能选择性禁用单个建筑。

## 为何整合为单一模组？

多个模组存在内容重叠（例如：矿物加工-冶金系统 与 化工处理-工业革命 共享 90%的建筑），导致模组互斥。此外，多模组分立将大幅增加维护成本——每次修复都需同步至所有版本。整合为单一模组实现"建筑不重复"，可彻底解决这些问题。

## What Content is in this mod?

This mod contains the content of the following mods:

- [Chemical Processing - Biochemistry](./Content/Chemical%20Processing%20-%20Biochemistry/)
- [Chemical Processing - Industrial Overhaul](./Content/Chemical%20Processing%20-%20Industrial%20Overhaul/)
- [Custom Generators](./Content/Custom%20Generators/)

- [Dupes Refrigeration](./Content/Dupes%20Refrigeration/)
- [High Pressure Applications](./Content/High%20Pressure%20Applications/)

A few buildings whose only difference were the looks have been merged into one building and blueprints.

You can find the full list for those [here](./Content/Blueprints).

## Only want some of those ?

If you only want some of that content, you can configure the mod that way!

You can both turn off entire sub-mods and individual buildings.

Find more info about the mod config [here](./ConfigEditor).

## What does "Remaster" mean

For the most part, this refers to quality of life additions, UI improvements and small bug fixes.
Some functions have been rewritten under the hood to be more maintainable, but for the most part, the mods should play like their original version.

I also made a few balance adjustments, but these can be changed or reverted in the mod config.

A (more or less) complete list of changes can be found [here](./tweaksAdjustments).

The largest deviation from the originals is the addition of heavy duty rails to High Pressure Applications, these serve as a rail version of high pressure pipes.
