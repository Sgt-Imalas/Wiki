# Configuration

The mod config can be found in the mods menu on the mod entry:

![modconfiglocation](/assets/images/ui/modconfiglocation.png)

The mod pack is fully modular. While it comes with all content enabled, you can turn off both buildings or entire mods in the config.

Toggle the entire mod via the "Enable Mod Content" checkbox in its category:

![config preview](/assets/images/ui/configpreview.png)

## Building Editor

The building editor can be accessed via the respective button at the top of the mod config screen.

It allows to individually turn off any building the mod adds and configure settings on some of them.

Buildings with configurable settings are marked by a gear icon

Buildings that were previously found in multiple different mods, will inherit the "enabled" state of the first mod entry listed
