# About this mod

## Whats this project?

As you might have heard, Ronivan has passed away.
His mods offer a massive expansion to regular progression and could be considered a dlc in scope.
they should not be lost to an update breaking them in the future (which is something that will happen eventually=.

for this reason, I have decided to make this project.

## Project Goals

The target of this project is the creation of one, huge mod that incorporates all of ronivans mods into one, configurable "modpack".
Individual components can be toggled off by the player if they do not want them in their game.
You will also be able to not only turn off sections, but individual buildings too.

## Why one mod?

Several mods have overlaps in content.
For example; Mineral Processing - Metallurgy shares nearly all its buildings with Chemical Processing - Industrial Overhaul, leaving the mods incompatible.
Additionally, having these amounts of "duplication" over several mods massively increases the maintainance effort, as a bugfix has to be transferred over to each of these versions.
Consolidating it down to "each building exists only once" minimizes these issues
