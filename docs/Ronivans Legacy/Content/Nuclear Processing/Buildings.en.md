## ABWR Reactor
The advanced boiling water reactor (ABWR) uses non-pressurized coolant for steam production. Its comparative small size favors for a quicker heating of the coolant, however, it also increases the odds of a Meltdown in the absence of cooling. Releases Steam in the area directly below its central tile segment.

Uses Enriched Uranium to produce Steam for electrical purpose.

## Rad Projector
A radiactive source containing radionuclids which emits ionizing radiation.

This device uses Uranium Ore. As the fuel decays, it turns to liquid Nuclear Waste, which is piped out of the source.

## Voloxidation Calcinator
Voloxidation process can separate uranium oxides from nuclear waste, along with other heavy elements. Produces waves of contaminating radiation while operational.

An advanced kiln capable of volumetric oxidation with heavy nuclear waste by alternating different stages of oxidation and reduction.

## Zippe-Type Centrifuge
A gas centrifuge is a device that performs isotope separation of gases. A centrifuge relies on the principles of centripetal force accelerating molecules so that particles of different masses are physically separated in a gradient along the radius of a rotating container.

The Zippe-type centrifuge is a gas device designed to enrich the rare fissile Enriched Uranium from the mixture of isotopes found in the manufactured Yellow Cake. The separation process releases small amounts of Depleted Uraniumas waste product.
