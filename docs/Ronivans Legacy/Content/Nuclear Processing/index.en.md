# Nuclear Processing

[**Original Mod Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2614715953)

This mod adds five new buildings to the game, and new features related to nuclear management.

idea on this was to create new interesting ways to use and process nuclear materials in Spaced Out.

Yellowcake now can be stored under Manufactured Materials tab, and also has its own unique texture, both for the object and the world mass.

Radium now can be stored under Consumable Ore tab, and also has its own unique texture.

**This sub-mod is not available in base game, it requires Spaced Out to be enabled!**

[Here are all buildings found in the mod.](./Buildings.md)

[The mod also reenables and reuses some disabled vanilla elements](./Elements)
