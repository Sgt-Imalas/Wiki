# High Pressure Applications

[**Original Mod Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2806200110)

This was based on Super Corgi mod Pressurized Pipes, from which Ronivan took the model for developing his own idea of High Pressure Application, expanding it with unique artwork for High Pressure Gas/Liquid Pipes and Bridges.

Also this mod includes new buildings, like the Decompressing Gas/Liquid Valves and High Pressure Gas/Liquid Pumps.

[Here are all buildings found in the mod.](./Buildings)

This mod now also contains "Heavy-Duty Rails", a rail equivalent of high pressure pipes to ship large amounts of solid items. They are also available in an insulation variant.

Newly added buildings to gas and liquid pipes:

- Compressor Vents; a new type of vent that requires power and allows outputting materials in high pressure environments.
- High Pressure Filter; a new filter building for all 3 types of conduits, it allows filtering multiple materials at once (can be used with any capacity pipe/rail)
