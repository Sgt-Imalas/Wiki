# Mineral Processing - Mining

[**Original Mod Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3358334623)

This set of modifications focus on the mining aspect by adding a new method to get elements.

The focus of the mod is on the mining drills: These buildings have two separate ways of producing materials from mining:

- Mining Results: When the Drillhead comes back and concludes the recipe, it will deliver the goods, which has a random chance and random amounts.
- Mining Occurences: The second way, and likely the more dangerous, depending on your selected drilling target, is during the drill operation, which have a chance of spawning random Occurrences. Keep in mind that the operation of this building can be extremely hazardous for you colony due to those.

You are also limited to one MkII drill per asteroid.

The MKI drill has been restored to function and can be constructed multiple times.

Guidance Modules of the MKII drill have been altered to slowly degrade during the operation instead of getting consumed. They also require programming (short crafting recipe or dupe interaction) as a measure to better distinguish the different mining operations

Chemical Processing Elements have also been added to the drill results (if the mod is set to enabled).
