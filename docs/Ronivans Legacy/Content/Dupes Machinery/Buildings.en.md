## Algae Vat
An advanced biological vat that grows algae. Due to the controlled atmospheric condition, this algae formation produces oxygen more efficiently than the standard terrarium. This unit also uses advanced filter to extract Carbon Dioxide from its surroundings, albeit its not necessery for it to function.

Algae patch needs Water to grow, producing a fair amount of clean Oxygen as result of its biological functions. Excess water is expelled in the form of Polluted Water.
