# Dupes Engineering

[**Original Mod Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2883629440)

This mod is a big merge of Ronivans old buildings mods, which include: Custom Tiles, Spacer Set and Wooden Set Structures.

[Here are all buildings found in the mod.](./Buildings)

[The mod also reenables and reuses some disabled vanilla elements](./Elements)

Placeable POIs have been removed from the mod to enable better compatibility with other mods that add partial sections of buildings that were missing here.

Several identical buildings have been merged into skins, check the [blueprint list](./../Blueprints) for those
