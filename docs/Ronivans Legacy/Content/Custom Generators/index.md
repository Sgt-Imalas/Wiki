# Custom Generators

This mod adds four new generators to the game, Custom Petroleum Generator, Custom Gas Generator, Steam Engine Generator and Custom Coal Generator.

Ronivan made this mod because he wanted a piston like generator that he could place in a row, and fully pipe their output.

The generator values are calculated based on their size in the game compared to the normal generator.

There is also a custom solar panel now that was not finished previously, following the same rules.

You can tweak the generator power values of the combustion generators in the mod configs' building editor.
