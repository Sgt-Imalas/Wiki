## Plasma Furnace
An advanced pyrometallurgical furnace that uses an extremely hot thermal plasma generated by a carrier gas jet. The high energy consumption is compensated by the quality and the yield of the refining process.

An advanced method for the refinement of Metal Ores and other Raw Minerals.

Produces significant amounts of Heat and consumes carrier gases during manufacturing.

Main products are dispensed in molten state directly in the floor below the building while the liquid waste is released in a separated port.
