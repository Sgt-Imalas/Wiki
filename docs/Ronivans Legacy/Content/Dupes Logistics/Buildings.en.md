# Buildings
## Insulated Storage Cabinet
Store solids and other industrial materials at a constant temperature moderation.

Store the Solid Materials of your choosing.
The cabinet prevents temperature exchange with the environment, as well gas leakage.
Takes items from conveyor rails based on its filters.
