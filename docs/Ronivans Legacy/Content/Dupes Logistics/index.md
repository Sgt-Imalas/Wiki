# Dupes Logistics

[**Original Mod Page**](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2809687723)

This is an quite old mod that was maintained for personal use.

In short its focused more on making the Solid Transportation buildings more accessible early on the game, and they don't require the skill necessary to build their base game counterparts.

Another good addition in the mod are the new storage buildings, with a small wall storage pod and 2 cabinets, one of which will cool-down or heat-up any solid stored within up to 24Â°C (no liquefiable solids are allowed in this storage building).

Another important feature that should be noted is that all storage buildings will only accept Automation handling except if its chosen to allow Duplicant use.

[Here are all buildings found in the mod.](./Buildings)

To balance out the earlier accessible logistic rails, they have been nerfed to a maximum throughput of 10kg/s (half of a regular rail). This can be adjusted/reverted in the config.

The Storage Cabinets now have a filtered rail input, allowing them to take in items from rails that are on the filter list.

The storage pods have been merged into one building + skins.

Individual building capacities can be configured in the mod configs' building editor
