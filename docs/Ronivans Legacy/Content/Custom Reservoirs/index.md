# Custom Reservoirs

This mod adds new buildings related to the safe storage of gases and liquids.

All buildings are insulated so there will be no heat exchange with their contents on the environment.

Another feature is that all the reservoirs of this mod will have an unique color change based on what element is stored within them. The color change will always take in consideration the element with the highest amount stored within if two or more are present.

Reservoir capacities are balanced against the vanilla reservoir capacity in comparison to their size, however they all can be configured to custom values in the mod configs' building editor.

Medium reservoirs will function without any specific port requirement.

The two variants of Small Reservoirs can be selected via building blueprint in the build menu.
