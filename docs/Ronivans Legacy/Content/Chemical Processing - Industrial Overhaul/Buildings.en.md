## Multi-Stage Crude Oil Refinery
An industrial process plant responsible for refining raw oil extracted from wells.

The refinery has two stages: 

First Stage: Crude Oil is first refined to:
- 50% Petroleum
- 25% Naphtha
- 10% Natural Gas
- 15% Bitumen.

Second Stage: Naphtha is furter refined:
- 45% Petroleum
- 10% Natural Gas
- 45% Bitumen.

The first stage uses Steam for the distillation process, while the second Stage uses Hydrogen to buffer the reaction.

## Oil Well (Modified)
Water pumped into an oil reservoir cannot be recovered.

Extracts Crude Oil using clean Water.

Must be built atop an Oil Reservoir.
