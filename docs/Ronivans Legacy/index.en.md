# About this mod

## Whats this project?

As you might have heard, Ronivan has passed away.
His mods offer a massive expansion to regular progression and could be considered a dlc in scope.
they should not be lost to an update breaking them in the future (which is something that will happen eventually).

for this reason, I have decided to make this project.

## Project Goals

The target of this project is the creation of one, huge mod that incorporates and remasters all of ronivans industrial mods into one, configurable "modpack".
Individual sub-mods can be toggled off by the player if they do not want them in their game.
You will also be able to not only turn off sections, but individual buildings too.

## Why one mod?

Several mods have overlaps in content.
For example; Mineral Processing - Metallurgy shares nearly all its buildings with Chemical Processing - Industrial Overhaul, leaving the mods incompatible.
Additionally, having these amounts of "duplication" over several mods massively increases the maintainance effort, as a bugfix has to be transferred over to each of these versions.
Consolidating it down to "each building exists only once" minimizes these issues

## What Content is in this mod?

This mod contains the content of the following mods:

- [Chemical Processing - Biochemistry](./Content/Chemical%20Processing%20-%20Biochemistry/)
- [Chemical Processing - Industrial Overhaul](./Content/Chemical%20Processing%20-%20Industrial%20Overhaul/)
- [Custom Generators](./Content/Custom%20Generators/)
- [Custom Reservoirs](./Content/Custom%20Reservoirs/)
- [Dupes Engineering](./Content/Dupes%20Engineering/)
- [Dupes Logistics](./Content/Dupes%20Logistics/)
- [Dupes Machinery](./Content/Dupes%20Machinery/)
- [Dupes Refrigeration](./Content/Dupes%20Refrigeration/)
- [High Pressure Applications](./Content/High%20Pressure%20Applications/)
- [Mineral Processing - Metallurgy](./Content/Mineral%20Processing%20-%20Metallurgy/)
- [Mineral Processing - Mining](./Content/Mineral%20Processing%20-%20Mining/)
- [Nuclear Processing](./Content/Nuclear%20Processing/)

A few buildings whose only difference were the looks have been merged into one building and blueprints.

You can find the full list for those [here](./Content/blueprints/).

## Only want some of those ?

If you only want some of that content, you can configure the mod that way!

You can both turn off entire sub-mods and individual buildings.

Find more info about the mod config [here](./configEditor/).

## What does "Remaster" mean

For the most part, this refers to quality of life additions, UI improvements and small bug fixes.
Some functions have been rewritten under the hood to be more maintainable, but for the most part, the mods should play like their original version.

I also made a few balance adjustments, but these can be changed or reverted in the mod config.

A (more or less) complete list of changes can be found [here](./tweaksAdjustments/).

The largest deviation from the originals is the addition of heavy duty rails to High Pressure Applications, these serve as a rail version of high pressure pipes.
