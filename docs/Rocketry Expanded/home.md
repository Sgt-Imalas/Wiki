# Rocketry Expanded
The rocket mod of rocket mods - what started of as a small "here are 2 new larger habitats" has now grown into a small-dlc-sized content pack for Oxygen Not Included - Spaced Out.
And I still have lots of plans regarding future content :) <br>
But the steam description has a word count limit, and it has been a mess to get any useful information out of it for quite a while now.<br>
For this reason I started making this wiki, providing detailed information about all bits and pieces of the mod while keeping it in a readable format.<br><br>
This wiki will be work in progress for quite some time while I add information to it.

# Mod Content
The following is a listing of all features of the mod grouped into categories.<br>
