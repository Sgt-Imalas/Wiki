# Fuel Loaders

Fuel Loaders are a new Type of loader building that attaches to the rocket platform.</br>
This new building type will fill up any fuel tank in connected rockets.</br>
The type of fuel is always dependant on the engine of the rocket; a fuel loader wont fill a liquid fuel tank or an oxidizer tank on a rocket with a steam engine.

Multiple Fuel Loaders can be used to increase fuel loading speed.
